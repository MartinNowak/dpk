simple package tool to build/install repositories

Installation:
  - You need to set an installation prefix in your dmd.conf/sc.ini by adding a [dpk] section

    [dpk]
    # mandatory
    PREFIX = "~/.local/D"
    # optional
    DEFAULTARGS = "-debug -gc -w -unittest"

  - Run "boot.sh | boot.bat" which will build a binary "dpk_boot"
  - Run "dpk_boot" to build an installation binary or alternatively run
    "dpk_boot install" to install dpk into your prefix dir

Usage:
  - Have a look at the examples directory for further instructions
